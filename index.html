				                Hey, nice to meet you!! I'm Yuting, a current sophomore at Carleton College. I'm a potential CS and Math double major, and Music Performance minor. As you may figure, the work for these majors and minor occupied most of my time unfortunately. However, I still love to make my limited leisure time colorful. During free time, I usually dance, hike, and talk with friends about life ðŸ˜‚.
